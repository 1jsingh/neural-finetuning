## Finetuning Convolutional Neural Networks using Neural Activation Data

This work looks at ways of improving the existing Convolutional Neural Networks using neural activation data obtained from the Visual Cortex of [Macaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque) while being presented with correspoding image stimuli.
